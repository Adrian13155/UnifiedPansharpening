# DURE
 This is a implementation of training code of this paper:  Deep Algorithm Unrolling with Registration Embedding for Pansharpening, ACM MM'23 # author: Tingting Wang, Yongxu Ye, Faming Fang, Guixu Zhang, Ming Xu 
 
 You can train our DURE model with your own data by simply modifying the path in Train.py to the path of your dataset. To train the model, use "python Train.py", and for testing, use "python Test.py".
